# REACH WAY Logo Implementation - REMOVED

## Overview
The REACH WAY logo was temporarily implemented but has been removed from all authentication pages due to display issues. The authentication pages now use a clean, logo-free design.

## Current Status
- ❌ **Logo Component**: Removed from `src/Components/Logo.jsx`
- ❌ **Login Page**: Logo removed, clean heading design
- ❌ **Signup Page**: Logo removed, clean heading design  
- ❌ **Forgot Password Page**: Logo removed, clean heading design

## What Was Removed
1. **Logo Component**: `src/Components/Logo.jsx` - Deleted
2. **Logo Imports**: Removed from all authentication pages
3. **Logo JSX**: Removed logo rendering from all pages
4. **Logo Styling**: Removed logo-specific CSS classes

## Current Design
The authentication pages now feature:
- **Clean Headings**: Large, centered page titles
- **Improved Spacing**: Better padding and margins without logo
- **Consistent Layout**: Uniform design across all auth pages
- **Professional Appearance**: Minimalist, focused design

## Files Modified
1. `src/Screens/Login/index.jsx` - Logo removed, spacing adjusted
2. `src/Screens/SignUp/index.jsx` - Logo removed, spacing adjusted
3. `src/Screens/ForgotPassword/index.jsx` - Logo removed, spacing adjusted

## Build Status

## Future Considerations
If you want to add a logo in the future:
1. Create a new logo component
2. Ensure proper SVG rendering
3. Test across different browsers and devices
4. Verify dark/light theme compatibility
